# SouthernBelleCulture-BackEnd
Capstone Project Back End
please see document in github
Capstone Project- Back End / Read.me
Overview This is my capstone project assignment that was given by General Assembly. Our assignment included creating a website of our choice. I based it on one to many relationships. I created a Single Page Application for the web that would allow a user to to interact with the website and the back end was used to authenticate the functions of CRUD.

How things went:
I started with what was needed to meet to MVP project requirements.  I created an ERD and wireframe.I worked on design using bootstrap, html, CSS and SASS.  I used HTML to Sign up with email, password and password confirmation HTML to code and backend api. I added HTML code for log out while logged in. I worked on Read.me, User stories as well tested the crud code with a few updates to fit my project needs such as not allowing delete or updating unless its the user. Added html code for changing password with current and new password I tested everything seems to be working fine.
